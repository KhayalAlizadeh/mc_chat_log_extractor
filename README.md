# mc_chat_log_extractor
extracts all chat logs from minecraft logs to txt files  

create a folder named "mc_chat" and put both c++ and python files in it, then run the c++ file first then run the python file. (you need to change the path in the python file)

running the c++ file will create a txt file named "gz_names.txt" in the mc_chat folder,

running the python file will create a folder named "end_result",

you can find the chat logs in the txt files that are in the "end_result" folder.
